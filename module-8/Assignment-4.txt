Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Script Development

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to give students hands-on experience in writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Students will choose one of the IaC tools studied (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) and develop a simple IaC script that provisions a cloud resource (e.g., a virtual machine) on a cloud service provider of their choice. The assignment aims to reinforce the practical application of IaC concepts.

Instructions:

Part 1: Tool Selection and Cloud Provider

Tool Selection: Choose one of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools studied in the course (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) to complete this assignment. Clearly state your choice in the assignment document.

Cloud Provider: Select a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) on which you will provision a cloud resource using your IaC script.

Part 2: IaC Script Development

Resource Selection: Decide what type of cloud resource you want to provision (e.g., a virtual machine, a database, a storage bucket). Provide a brief rationale for your choice.

Script Development: Develop a simple IaC script using your chosen IaC tool to provision the selected cloud resource. Include all necessary configurations and dependencies within your script.

Configuration Parameters: If your IaC tool supports it, use variables or parameters for essential configurations (e.g., instance size, region) to make your script reusable and adaptable.

Comments and Documentation: Add comments and documentation within your IaC script to explain its purpose, resource definitions, and any notable configurations.

Part 3: Execution and Testing

Execution Instructions: Provide clear instructions on how to execute your IaC script to provision the cloud resource. Include any prerequisites, such as installing the IaC tool or configuring cloud provider credentials.

Testing: After provisioning, verify that the cloud resource is successfully created. If applicable, include commands or steps to check the resource's status or availability.

Part 4: Submission and Evaluation

Submission: Students should submit their IaC Script Development assignment, including the IaC script and relevant documentation, as a compressed archive (e.g., .zip) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].
Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Script Quality: The quality and correctness of the IaC script, including proper configuration, dependencies, and documentation.
Clarity: The clarity and completeness of instructions for executing the script and verifying the provisioned resource.
Resource Selection: The rationale behind the choice of the cloud resource and its suitability for the assignment.

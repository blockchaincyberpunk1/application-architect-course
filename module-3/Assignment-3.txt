API Design Review

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to enable students to analyze and evaluate API design choices. Students will select a popular web API (e.g., Twitter API, Google Maps API) or a hypothetical API and conduct a critical review. They will assess the API's adherence to RESTful principles or GraphQL and evaluate its ease of use and consistency.

Instructions:

API Design Review:

Select an API: Instruct students to choose a web API for review. They can select from popular APIs like Twitter, Google Maps, or any other API of interest. Alternatively, they may create a hypothetical API with a defined purpose.

Review Criteria: Explain to students that their review should focus on the following aspects:

Adherence to Principles: Assess whether the API follows RESTful principles, GraphQL principles, or any other design approach it claims to implement. Consider aspects such as resource representation, URI structure, HTTP methods, and statelessness.

Ease of Use: Evaluate how easy it is for developers to understand and use the API. Analyze the clarity of documentation, naming conventions, and the simplicity of making requests.

Consistency: Check for consistency in API design. Ensure that similar functionalities or resources are exposed using consistent patterns. Evaluate the use of status codes, error handling, and response formats.

Review Document: Instruct students to create a structured review document. The document should include the following sections:

Introduction: Briefly introduce the selected API and its purpose.

Review Findings: For each aspect mentioned in the review criteria, provide a detailed assessment. Use clear examples or case studies to illustrate your points. Include screenshots, code snippets, or any other relevant visuals.

Recommendations: Offer constructive recommendations for improving the API's design or usability. Suggest potential enhancements or areas where the API could better align with design principles.

Submission: Students should submit their review document as a file (e.g., PDF) by [Due Date] at [Due Time].

Grading: Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Analysis: The depth of analysis and evaluation of the selected API's design choices.
Clarity: The clarity, organization, and completeness of the review document.
Constructive Feedback: The quality and relevance of recommendations provided for improvement.
